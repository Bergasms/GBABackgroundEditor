# GBABackgroundEditor
A simple editor for Gameboy Advance tile backgrounds.     

A rudimentary tool that lets you define a palette, draw 8x8 tiles and assemble them into a background map. Written more as an exercise in learning Zig than as something other people will use. It uses Zgui, a wrapper around imgui, to draw the UI.
